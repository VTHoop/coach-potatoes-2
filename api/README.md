### Summary
This web application scrapes the HNIR.net website specifically for the recreational hockey team, the Richmond Couch Potatoes, with its main purpose to set and display the attedance for each game.

The schedule will be automatically generated based on the schedule scraped from the website and the attendance for the game will able to be set for the team's roster.

The roster is generally scraped from the website as well.  Additionally, there are modifications based on players that are on the team, but not on the website as well as players that are on the website, but not really on the team.  Those values are hardcoded and handled in the code.
